			<br>
			Stir together:
			<br><em>1/4 Cup Water</em>
			<br><em>1 Packet Yeast</em>
			<br><em>2 Teaspoons Sugar</em>
			<br>
			Let sit for 10 minutes
			<br>Mixture should turn foamy. If not, get new yeast.
			<br>
			<br>
			Whisk in:
			<br><em>1 1/4 Cups Water</em>
			<br><em>1 Full Egg</em>
			<br><em>3 Egg Yolks</em>
			<br><em>1/4 Cup Honey</em>
			<br><em>2 Tablespoons Canola Oil</em>
			<br><em>2 Tablespoons Salt</em>
			<br>Incorporate everything thoroughly.
			<br>
			<br>
			Add <em>4 1/2-6 cups of flour</em> in increments of 1/2 a cup at a time. Stir between increments with a large spoon.
			<br>
			When it becomes too thick to stir, knead with your hands.
			<br>
			Add flour and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, but not sticky.

			<span style='font-size:25px;font-family:biscuit'>Instructions- Dough Work</span>
			<br>
			Grease your second mixing bowl with <em>canola oil</em>.
			<br>
			Move your dough into the new bowl and flip it around to coat it in oil.
			<br>
			<br>
			If it's <em>warm outside</em>, cover bowl in plastic wrap and sit it by a window to rise.
			<br>
			If it's <em>cold outside</em>, boil a pot of water and place it on the <em>lower oven rack</em>. Cover the bowl in a <em>damp dishcloth</em> and put it on the <em>top oven rack</em>. Close the oven.
			<br>
			Wait <em>1 hour</em>, or until size doubles.
			<br>
			Punch the dough to remove air.
			<br>
			Wait another <em>hour</em>.
			<br>
			Punch again.
            <br>
            <br>
			Dust <em>flour</em> on a <em>cutting board</em> (or baking tray, or another smooth surface you can use to roll out dough)
			<br>
			Knead dough on the board. It doesn't need a ton of kneading - just until you can press your finger into it and the indent will bounce back.
			<br>
			<br>
			Separate the dough into as many parts as loaves you want.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p class='cardslong' style='font-family:klee;top:1500px'>
			<span style='font-size:25px;font-family:biscuit'>Instructions- More Dough Work</span>

			<br>
			Work one loaf at a time, and set the other parts of dough off to the side.
			<br>
			Divide the dough into three equal parts with a <em>knife</em>.
			<br>
			Roll these parts out with a <em>rolling pin</em> until it is 1/4 inch thick.
			<br>
			With your hands, roll each part up into a strand, sort of like a long cylinder. 
			<br>
			Keep pressure on it as you roll so no air pockets collect. Roll it back and forth to smooth it out, and taper a bit at the ends so it's thicker in the middle.
			<br>
			<br>
			Lay the three strands side by side and braid them.
			<br>
			Start in the middle, then flip it around and do the other side. When you're done, tuck the ends underneath the loaf to make it nice and pretty!
			<br>
			<br>
			Repeat the steps in this section for as many loaves as you're making.
			<br>
			While you're doing this, if you're letting the dough rise in the oven with a pot of boiling water under it, you should put a pot of water on the stove to boil. You'll need it soon.

			<span style='font-size:25px;font-family:biscuit'>Instructions- Finishing Touches and Baking</span>
			<br>
			Mix egg wash in a <em>cup</em>
			<br><em>1 egg</em>
			<br><em>1 Tbsp cold water</em>
			<br><em>1/2 Tbsp salt</em>
			<br><em>1/2 Tbsp honey</em>
			<br>
			<br>
			Whisk with a <em>fork</em> until smooth.
			<br>
			Brush over the top of the braided loaves. Don't use up all the egg wash, you'll need it later.
			<br>
			<br>
			Let the loaves rise for <em>30-45 minutes,</em> or until they bounce back when you press into them.
			<br>
			When you've got about <em>20 minutes</em> left, take the loaves (and your pot of water) out of the oven (if that's where you have them rising), and start preheating the oven to <em>350 degrees</em>
			<br>
			<br>
			Bake for <em>20 minutes</em>
			<br>
			Remove from oven, coat with more <em>egg wash</em>. Focus on the parts that haven't turned golden.
			<br>
			Bake again for <em>20 minutes</em>. Total bake time is 40 minutes.
			<br>
			<br>
			Done! If the challah starts going stale, you can make french toast from it.
